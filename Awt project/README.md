This is a simple Java Swing application that demonstrates how to create a graphical user interface (GUI) using various Swing components. The application consists of a form that prompts the user to enter their name, password, address, gender, and whether they want to subscribe to a newsletter.

The GUI is built using JFrame and JPanel containers. The components used in this application include JLabel, JTextField, JPasswordField, JTextArea, JCheckBox, JRadioButton, ButtonGroup, and JButton.

The application uses a submit button to collect the user's input from the various components and display the information in a JOptionPane message dialog.


The ActionListener interface is implemented to listen to the submit button's action event and retrieve the user's input from the form's components. The user's input is then displayed in a JOptionPane message dialog.

This application is a good starting point for learning how to build Java Swing applications with different components and how to handle events in a GUI application. It can be extended to perform more complex tasks and to add additional components to the GUI.
